# SnowballGame
 ![Alt text](SnowballGame.png)

Javascript Node and React project that allows users to connect to the server hosted on Railway and play a multiplayer snowball game that teleports the user to a random spawn point after being hit with a snowball. The user can click around their screen to select where they wish to throw the snowball and use their arrow keys to move.
The server accomplishes hosting this service by tracking each player by their port and allowing each port to send an input before updating the server for everyone else on the server giving the user 60 frames to provide an input before updating.
